-- SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY item_price ASC

-- 2. Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).

-- SELECT * FROM items WHERE item_price >= 80 ORDER BY item_price DESC

-- 3. The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) â€“ 
-- 	  exclude the primary key column from the results.

-- SELECT customer_firstname FROM customers ORDER BY customer_firstname ASC LIMIT 3

-- 4. All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)

-- SELECT customer_lastname FROM customers ORDER BY customer_lastname DESC
